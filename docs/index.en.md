## What is it?

MySpeed is a speed test analysis software that stores the speed of your internet for up to 30 days. This can also be
useful if you want to know when your network might have drops or if you want to check if your internet matches the
booked values from your contract.

It is recommended to install the software at home. Of course, it can also be installed on a server in a data center, if
you wish ;)

## How does it work?

MySpeed automatically creates tests every hour, which you can view in a dashboard. If a test is older than 30 days, it
will be deleted to keep the dashboard clearer.

## What do I need?

In summary, just a device that is capable of running **24/7** and is supported by **NodeJS**. This includes Windows,
macOS or Linux, among others.

Even though it is possible to install the system on a normal computer, it is recommended to install it on a device that
consumes little power. Perfect for this would be for example a so-called [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com/) or
other [Mini-PCs](https://www.amazon.de/s?k=mini+pc).
